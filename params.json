It turns\r\na UNIX workstation into a DVMRP multicast router with tunnel support, in order\r\nto cross non-multicast-aware routers.\r\n\r\nDVMRP is a distance vector based protocol, derived from RIP, suitable for\r\nclosely located multicast users in smaller networks.  It simply floods all\r\nmulticast streams to all routers, i.e. implicit join.  This is also known as\r\n\"flood and prune\" since you can opt out from groups you do not want. For a\r\ndetailed explanation of the protocol, consult RFC 1075.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n-------\r\nThe mrouted routing daemon was developed by Steve Deering, Ajit Thyagarajan,\r\nBill Fenner, David Thaler and Daniel Zappala.  With contributions by many\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe last release by Mr. Fenner was 3.9-beta3 on April 26 1999 and mrouted has\r\nbeen in \"beta\" status since then.  Several prominent UNIX operating systems,\r\nsuch as AIX, Solaris, HP-UX, BSD/OS, NetBSD, FreeBSD, OpenBSD as well as most\r\nGNU/Linux based distributions have used that beta as a de facto stable release,\r\nwith (mostly) minor patches for system adaptations.  Over time however many\r\ndropped support, but Debian and OpenBSD kept it under their wings.\r\n\r\nIn March 2003 OpenBSD, led by the fearless Theo de Raadt, managed to convince\r\nStanford to release mrouted under a fully free license, the BSD license[1].\r\nNevertheless, in February 2005 Debian finally dropped[2] mrouted as an\r\n\"obsolete protocol\".\r\n\r\nFor a long time the OpenBSD team remained the sole guardian of this project.\r\n\r\nIn 2010 this effort of bringing mrouted back to life was started.  The 3.9.x\r\nstable series represent the first releases in over a decade.  Patches from all\r\nover the Internet, including OpenBSD, have been integrated.\r\n\r\nBugs\r\n----\r\nThe basic functionality has been tested thoroughly over the years, but that\r\ndoes not mean mrouted is bug free.  Please report any oddities, feature\r\nrequests, patches or pull requests in the github issue tracker at:\r\n\r\n\thttp://github.com/troglobit/mrouted/issues\r\n\r\nMrouted contain \"hacks\" to recognize Cisco IOS's pseudo-DVMRP implementation to\r\nyield all \"DVMRP\" versions of 10 and higher to IOS.  Previous pre-release\r\nversions of mrouted 3.9.0 made the assumption that the IOS bug that causes it\r\nto use the IOS version number instead of the DVMRP version number would be\r\nfixed by the time 12.0 was out.\r\n\r\nConfiguring\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nBy default mrouted reads its configuration file from /etc/mrouted.conf.  You can\r\noverride the default by specifying an alternate file when invoking mrouted.\r\n\r\n\tmrouted -f /path/file.conf\r\n\r\nThe mrouted daemon can reconfigure itself at runtime if you change the configuration\r\nfile, simply send the process a SIGHUP to activate new changes to the file.  The PID\r\nis saved automatically to the file /var/run/mrouted.pid at start.\r\n\r\nBy default, mrouted configures itself to act as a multicast router on all multicast\r\ncapable interfaces, excluding the loopback interface that has the IFF_MULTICAST flag\r\nset.  Therefore, you do not need to explicitly configure mrouted, unless you need to\r\nsetup tunnel links, change the default operating parameters, or disable multicast\r\nrouting over a specific physical interface.\r\n\r\nSee the man page for further details.\r\n\r\nRunning\r\n-------\r\nThe mrouted daemon must run as root.\r\n\r\nFor the native mrouted tunnel to work in Linux based systes you need to have\r\nthe \"ipip\" kernel module loaded or as built-in.\r\n\r\n\tmodprobe ipip\r\n\r\nSeveral signals are supported, for querying status, or simply for reloading the\r\nconfiguration.  See the man page for details.\r\n\r\nMROUTED 3.8\r\n===========\r\nMrouted 3.8 has two optional features: SNMP and RSRR.  RSRR support is\r\nrequired for running RSVP; the SNMP code, with the help of the ISODE snmpd,\r\nimplements both the Multicast MIB and the DVMRP MIB.\r\n\r\nRSRR\r\n----\r\nRouting Support for Resource Reservations (RSRR) was contributed by\r\nDaniel Zappala <daniel@isi.edu>.\r\n\r\nNote: This has not been tested in many years ...\r\n\r\nTo enable RSRR support, uncomment the three lines starting with RSRR near\r\nthe top of the Makefile and \"make clean; make\".  Or use the prebuilt binary,\r\nmrouted.rsrr .\r\n\r\nRSRR allows RSVP to query mrouted for its routing entry for a particular\r\nsource-group pair.  Using the routing entry and the IP_MULTICAST_VIF socket\r\ncall, RSVP can forward distinct control messages out each outgoing\r\ninterface.  This version of mrouted supports RSRR messages using a Unix\r\ndatagram socket.\r\n\r\nRSRR currently includes two pairs of query-reply messages.  RSVP sends an\r\nInitial Query when it starts.  Mrouted responds with an Initial Reply that\r\nincludes the set of vifs it is using, flagging those that are\r\nadministratively disabled.  When RSVP needs the routing entry for a\r\nsource-group pair, it sends a Route Query.  Mrouted responds with a Route\r\nReply that includes the incoming vif and outgoing vifs for the source-group\r\npair.\r\n\r\nRSVP may request route change notification by setting the notification bit\r\nin the Route Query.  If mrouted can provide route change notification for\r\nthe source-group pair, it sets the notification bit in its Route Reply.\r\nWhen the routing entry for the source-group pair changes, mrouted sends an\r\nunsolicited Route Reply containing the new routing information.  The initial\r\nrelease of mrouted 3.5 did not support route change notification and always\r\nreturned a Route Reply with the notification bit cleared.  This release of\r\nmrouted provides route change notification when possible.\r\n\r\nSNMP\r\n----\r\nSNMP support was contributed by David Thaler <thalerd@eecs.umich.edu>.\r\nNote: This has not been tested in many years ...\r\n\r\nTo enable SNMP support, uncomment the six lines near the top of the Makefile\r\nbelow the description of SNMP support.\r\n\r\nTo link the SNMP-capable mrouted, you need the CMU libraries.  See\r\nhttp://nic.merit.edu/~mbone/ for a full mrouted-snmp distribution.\r\n\r\nMake sure to add the \"sysName\", \"sysContact\", \"sysVersion\" and \"sysLocation\"\r\nvariables to your /etc/mrouted.conf if you want them to provide anything\r\nother than default values.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nsysName\t\"tibia\"\r\nsysContact \"Bill Fenner <fenner@parc.xerox.com> +1 415 812-4816\"\r\nsysVersion \"SunOS 4.1.3 and mrouted 3.8\"\r\nsysLocation \"MAXC room, PARC building 35\"\r\n\r\nThe SNMP version of mrouted has an additional command line flag:\r\n\r\n  -P snmp_port\r\n\r\n     Specifies a port for SNMP communication (default 161).  This option\r\n     should be used when another SNMP daemon already exists.  The preferred\r\n     alternate port in this case is port 9161.\r\n\r\nThe mstat(8) program allows querying of statistics using SNMP.\r\n\r\nFootnotes\r\n---------\r\n[1] - http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/usr.sbin/mrouted/LICENSE\r\n[2] - http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=288112","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
